In this project, I have written a command line utility to synthesize audio

data containing Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals and to detect DTMF

signals in audio data.

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with C programming,

with a focus on input/output, bitwise manipulations, and the use of pointers.
